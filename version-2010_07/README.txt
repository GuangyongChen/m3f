This is the initial release with working demo, released in July 2010.

This code requires the GNU Scientific Library and the Tom Minka's Lightspeed Toolbox to be installed on your system. 

It has been tested successfully with UNIX MATLAB versions 2007b (64-bit), 2008a (64-bit), and 2010a (32-bit); however it requires revision 1.4.4.7 of wishrnd.m, which is only included in 2008a and more recent versions. 

It has not been tested on Windows and OSX platforms.
